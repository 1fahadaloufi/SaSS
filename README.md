## [Project Name]
Description of functionality, how to use it, and any supporting equipment required. Here also link to the user manual document within the github repository. 

## Pin Layout
Put all the GPIO pin numbers, i/o/io determination, and labels. Start labeling the GPIOs from 0 to 33 rather than from 4 - 37. 

## Supporting Equipment
List all the required equipment and upload a breadboard with the equipment set up (recommend using tinkercad circuits if possible)

## RTL Diagrams
Only show and describe your top-level RTL that shows the total # of flip flops here. For the rest of your RTLs, link to a "docs" directory within the GitHub page
that shows all component RTLs, state diagrams, and the top level RTL. Please have those as a PDF or a JPEG.

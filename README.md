## Synth & Sequencer
This project is an ASIC for a synthesizer that takes in 13 "piano key" inputs and outputs their corresponding sounds. The synthesizer features 3 different waveforms to choose from: square, sawtooth, and triangle. The synthesizer also has an octave mode allowing the user to cycle through 7 possible octaves.

In addition to "piano mode," the ASIC also has a sequencer mode. The sequencer mode has 8 beats whose notes can be edited to form a repeating sound pattern. Within sequencer mode, the tempo can be adjusted between 4 settings.

## Supporting Equipment
List all the required equipment and upload a breadboard with the equipment set up (recommend using tinkercad circuits if possible)

## RTL Diagrams
All the stuff from the proposal goes here, obviously updated from the time you did the proposal to the final layout
Include more than just block diagrams, including sub-block diagrams, state-transition diagrams, flowcharts, and timing diagrams

## Statement from Purdue
